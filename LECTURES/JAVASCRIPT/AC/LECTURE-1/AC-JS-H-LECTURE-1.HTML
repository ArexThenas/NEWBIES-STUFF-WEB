    <h1>JAVASCRIPT LECTURE-1</h1>
    <hr>
    <pre>
        JavaScript is a dynamically typed programming language which is mainly used to give instructions to web browsers...

        One can use "console" to type and test JS code in a browser instead of using a code editor like vs code, 
        though it is to be noted that the code will not be saved in the browser or in any file if you are using console...
    </pre><hr>
    <h3>CONSOLE.LOG</h3>
    <hr>
    <pre>
        <code>Console.log();</code> is used to log or print a message to the console...

            If you type JS code in the console directly you will have to press enter in order to execute it,
            but you won't have to press enter when using a JS document...

            Example : 
                        <code>
                            console.log("Hello World!");
                        </code>
            Output  : 
                        <samp>
                            Hello World!
                        </samp>

            Extra : The extension <code>.js</code> is used to make JavaScript files...
                    You have to link a JavaScript file to an HTML file because the browser can't directly use a JavaScript file,
                    use script tag and src attribute in html for linking...

    <h3>VARIABLES</h3>
    <hr>
    <pre>
        In JavaScript, a variable is like a named container that stores data...
    </pre>
    <hr>
    <h3>VARIABLE RULES</h3>
    <hr>
    <pre>
        The rules i have been taught so far are as follows -

            A. Variable names are case sensitive ; "a" and "A" are not the same...
            B. Only letters, digits, underscores and dollar sign are allowed... 
                Note : Even space between characters is not allowes...
            C. Digits cannot be the first character in a variable name...
            D. Reserved words cannot be variable names...

                Extra :  Its usually considered a good practice to use camel case when naming a variable...
                         Some of the cases are as follows... 

                            1. Camel case : <code>fullName</code>
                            2. Snake case : <code>full_name</code>
                            3. Kebab case : <code>full-name</code>
                            4. Pascal case : <code>FullName</code>
    </pre><hr>
    <h3>VARIABLE DECLARATION KEYWORDS</h3>
    <hr>
    <pre>
        Variable declaration keywords or simply keywords are used to declare variables...
        Currently we are going to talk about var, let and const...

            A. Var : Here, variable can be re-declared and updated... A global scope variable...
            B. Let : Here, variable cannot be re-declared but can be updated... A block scope variable...
            C. Const : Here, variable can neither be updated or re-declared... A block scope variable...

                Mostly let and const are used by coders nowadays, var was used before 2015 when ES6 was yet to be introduced...

    <h3>DATA TYPES IN JS</h3>
    <hr>
    <pre>
        Broadly speaking, there are two types of data types in JS...

            A. Primitive data types
                                    There are seven primitive data types and these seven are mentioned below...

                                            1. Number
                                            2. String
                                            3. Boolean
                                            4. Undefined
                                            5. Null
                                            6. Bigint
                                            7. Symbol
            B. Non-primitive data types
                                    So far only one non primitive data type has been mentioned...

                                            1. Object
    </pre><hr>
    <h3>OBJECT</h3><hr>
    <pre>
        An object is a non primitive data type in JS... It can be used to group variables...

        Example :
                    <code>
                        Const Student = {
                            fullName : "Rahul",
                            age : 20,
                            cgpa: 8.2,
                            isPass : True
                        };
                        console.log(Student);
                    </code>
        Output :
                    <samp>
                        {fullName: 'Rahul', age: 20, cgpa: 8.2, isPass: true}
                            age : 20
                            cgpa : 8.2
                            fullName : "Rahul"
                            isPass : true
                    </samp>

        To print a variable or key of an object use <code>console.log(Student["age"]);</code>...

        Example :
                    <code>
                        console.log(Student["age"]);
                        console.log(Student["cgpa"]);
                    </code>
        Output : 
                    <samp>
                        20
                        8.2
                    </samp>
        
        To change the value of a variable use <code>Student["age"] = Student["age"]+1;</code>...

        Example :
                    <code>
                        Student["age"] = Student["age"]+1;
                        Student["fullName"] = "Rahul Sharma";
                        console.log(Student["age"])
                        console.log(Student["fullName"])
                    </code>
        Output : 
                    <samp>
                        21
                        Rahul Sharma
                    </samp>
                    
            Extra : You cannot change a constant variable's value but you can change the keys of a const object,
                    because a single change does not imply that the whole object has changed...
